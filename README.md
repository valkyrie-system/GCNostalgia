* Copy the entire `GCNostalgia` folder to your KDE Plasma local look-and-feel directory:
    ```bash
    cp -r GCNostalgia ~/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/
    ```

**2. Apply the Splash Screen:**

### ðŸŽ¨ Customization:

You can personalize the splash screen's appearance by editing the QML file:

* **Location:** `~/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/GCNostalgia/contents/splash/splash.qml`

* **Colors:**
    * Open `splash.qml` in a text editor.
    * Look for properties like `color: "#000000"` (root background) or `color: "#eff0f1"` (text color).
    * Change the hexadecimal color codes to your desired values.

* **Images/GIFs:**
    * The main GameCube animation is specified by `source: "images/plasma_d.gif"`. You can replace this GIF with your own by updating the `source` path and placing your GIF in the `GCNostalgia/contents/splash/images/` directory.
    * Similarly, the busy indicator (`images/busywidget.gif`) and KDE logo (`images/kde.svgz`) can be customized.

### ðŸ”Š Optional Boot Sound:

To play the iconic GameCube boot sound, you'll need to create a simple autostart script. This script uses `paplay` (part of PulseAudio/PipeWire) to play a WAV file.

~~1. Prepare Your Sound File:~~

~~* Obtain the `Nintendo_Gamecube_Boot.wav` sound file.~~
~~* Place it in a secure location, for example: `~/.config/autostart-scripts/` (create this directory if it doesn't exist).~~
    
~~**Folder with script is now supplied in this repo with the wav, otherwise provide your own**~~ ```

**Users can also set their login sound with the provided .WAV file for the splash screen at "System Settings > Apps & Windows > Notifications > System Notifications (top right) > Login" though it might not be properly timed**

### Optional: Delay Plasma 6.5 Startup Service

This systemd user service introduces a 6-second delay during Plasma 6.5 startup. This can be beneficial for systems where background services or network connections need a bit more time to initialize before the desktop environment fully loads.
Installation Steps

    Place the service file: Copy the provided plasma-delay.service file into your user's systemd configuration directory:
    Bash

mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/
cp plasma-delay.service ~/.config/systemd/user/

(Assuming plasma-delay.service is in your current directory.)

Reload systemd and enable the service:
Bash

    systemctl --user daemon-reload
    systemctl --user enable plasma-delay.service

    Restart your system (or log out and back in) for the service to take effect.

Verification (Optional)

To check the service's status:
Bash

systemctl --user status plasma-delay.service

You should see active (exited) and enabled in the output.
