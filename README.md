### ðŸŽ¨ Customization:

You can personalize the splash screen's appearance by editing the QML file:

* **Location:** `~/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/GCNostalgia/contents/splash/splash.qml`

* **Colors:**
    * Open `splash.qml` in a text editor.
    * Look for properties like `color: "#000000"` (root background) or `color: "#eff0f1"` (text color).
    * Change the hexadecimal color codes to your desired values.

* **Images/GIFs:**
    * The main GameCube animation is specified by `source: "images/plasma_d.gif"`. You can replace this GIF with your own by updating the `source` path and placing your GIF in the `GCNostalgia/contents/splash/images/` directory.
    * Similarly, the busy indicator (`images/busywidget.gif`) and KDE logo (`images/kde.svgz`) can be customized.

### ðŸ”Š Optional Boot Sound:

To play the iconic GameCube boot sound, you'll need to create a simple autostart script. This script uses `paplay` (part of PulseAudio/PipeWire) to play a WAV file.

~~1. Prepare Your Sound File:~~

~~* Obtain the `Nintendo_Gamecube_Boot.wav` sound file.~~
~~* Place it in a secure location, for example: `~/.config/autostart-scripts/` (create this directory if it doesn't exist).~~
    
~~**Folder with script is now supplied in this repo with the wav, otherwise provide your own**~~ ```

**Users can also set their login sound with the provided .WAV file for the splash screen at "System Settings > Apps & Windows > Notifications > System Notifications (top right) > Login" though it might not be properly timed**
