### âœ¨ Features:

* **Authentic GameCube Boot Animation:** A nostalgic GIF plays during startup.
* **Customizable Colors:** Easily tweak the splash screen's background and text colors.
* **Optional Boot Sound:** Add the classic GameCube startup chime for a complete experience.

---

### ðŸš€ Installation:

**1. Download and Place the Theme:**

* Clone this repository or download the `GCNostalgia` folder.
* Copy the entire `GCNostalgia` folder to your KDE Plasma local look-and-feel directory:
    ```bash
    cp -r GCNostalgia ~/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/
    ```

**2. Apply the Splash Screen:**

* Open **KDE System Settings**.
* Navigate to **"Appearance"** (or "Workspace Behavior" -> "Splash Screen" in older versions).
* Select **"Splash Screen"**.
* Choose **"GCNostalgia"** from the list.
* Click **"Apply"**.

### ðŸŽ¨ Customization:

You can personalize the splash screen's appearance by editing the QML file:

* **Location:** `~/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/GCNostalgia/contents/splash/splash.qml`

* **Colors:**
    * Open `splash.qml` in a text editor.
    * Look for properties like `color: "#000000"` (root background) or `color: "#eff0f1"` (text color).
    * Change the hexadecimal color codes to your desired values.

* **Images/GIFs:**
    * The main GameCube animation is specified by `source: "images/plasma_d.gif"`. You can replace this GIF with your own by updating the `source` path and placing your GIF in the `GCNostalgia/contents/splash/images/` directory.
    * Similarly, the busy indicator (`images/busywidget.gif`) and KDE logo (`images/kde.svgz`) can be customized.

### ðŸ”Š Optional Boot Sound:

To play the iconic GameCube boot sound, you'll need to create a simple autostart script. This script uses `paplay` (part of PulseAudio/PipeWire) to play a WAV file.

~~1. Prepare Your Sound File:~~

~~* Obtain the `Nintendo_Gamecube_Boot.wav` sound file.~~
~~* Place it in a secure location, for example: `~/.config/autostart-scripts/` (create this directory if it doesn't exist).~~
~~```bash~~
    ~~mkdir -p ~/.config/autostart-scripts/~~
    ~~cp /path/to/Nintendo_Gamecube_Boot.wav ~/.config/autostart-scripts/~~
``` **Folder with script is now supplied in this repo with the wav, otherwise provide your own**

    ***Users can also set their login sound for the splash screen at "System Settings > Apps & Windows > Notifications > System Notifications (top right) > Login" though it might not be properly timed**

**2. Create the Login Script:**

* Create a new file named `gamecube_boot_sound.sh` in the same directory:
    `~/.config/autostart-scripts/gamecube_boot_sound.sh`

* Paste the following content into the file:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    # Wait for the splash screen to finish its animation
    # Adjust '5.1' seconds if your splash screen duration changes
    sleep 5.1

    # Play the GameCube boot sound using paplay (requires PulseAudio/PipeWire)
    paplay "/home/$(whoami)/.config/autostart-scripts/Nintendo_Gamecube_Boot.wav"

    exit 0
    ```
    * **Explanation:**
        * `sleep 5.1`: This command pauses the script for 5.1 seconds. This delay is crucial to ensure the sound plays *after* the visual splash animation is complete. You calculated your GIF duration to be 5.06 seconds, so 5.1 seconds provides a small buffer. If you change your GIF's duration in `splash.qml`, remember to update this `sleep` value.
        * `paplay`: This command plays audio files via PulseAudio or PipeWire (which is compatible with PulseAudio).
        * `"/home/$(whoami)/.config/autostart-scripts/Nintendo_Gamecube_Boot.wav"`: This constructs the path to your sound file dynamically, ensuring it works for any user.

**3. Make the Script Executable:**

* Open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    chmod +x ~/.config/autostart-scripts/gamecube_boot_sound.sh
    ```

**4. Add the Script to Autostart:**

* Open **KDE System Settings**.
* Navigate to **"Startup and Shutdown"** (or "Workspace" -> "Autostart").
* Click **"Add Program..."**.
* In the file chooser, browse to `~/.config/autostart-scripts/` and select `gamecube_boot_sound.sh`.
* Click **"OK"**.
